v0.4: Mon, Feb 10 1997
* Implemented computed remotes.
* Fixed buggy algorithm for extending repetitions.
* Fixed bug, that allowed to bind a virtual to a virtual.


v0.3:
* Updated some of the documentation.
* Full support for virtual patterns.
* General if imperative.
* A btree container was added.
* Explicite handling of the type of a numerical expression.
* Migration to version 5.2 of the Mjolner BETA system.


v0.2:
* Changed semantics for virtual functions: the virtual creator function
  now either creates an object or fills in a pattern variable according
  to the virtual types.  The actual action depends on the parameters
  passed:

	struct object *V(struct object *enclosing, struct pvariable *pv);

  If the pv argument is zero, an object is created and a point to it
  is returned.  If pv is non-zero, information about the virtual
  object is stored into it, and the object creator function returns
  0.

* The Object Creator functions now can actually call other
  patterns.  If a LEAVE or RESTART imperative is triggered inside
  such a pattern, and cannot be handled there, the creation of
  the object will be aborted, and the Object Creator Function
  returns 0.

* Jiri Sitera <sitera@zcu.cz> added two changes:
  - You can create a list of the slots and their bindings by
    specifying the "-m" option to b2c.  The list is output in a
    program named <job>.sb, where <job> is the first filename
    specified to b2c.

    As this process relies on the ".fm" files to be present for
    each fragment of the current compile, and as these ".fm" files
    are only created, if the "-m" option had been specified, you
    may have to use the "-f" option along with "-m" to force a
    recompile of everything.

  - The storage of repetitions was changed to include another
    field, alsize, to allow the storage of the repetition to be
    allocated independently of its actual size.  That way, the
    system can choose independently of the BETA application, in
    which junks it extends a repetition's size.

* Jan Okrouhly <okrouhly@zcu.cz> has created a garbage collector.


v0.1:
This was the first version, that I gave to other people by sending
e-mail.
