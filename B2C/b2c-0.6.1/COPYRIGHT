Permission is granted to view, print, compile and modify the
files in this directory for studying the compiler, or for
developping, debugging and testing the compiler, as well, as for
toying around with BETA or even starting real BETA work,
provided, that you do not use it for mass violation of human
rights, as stated in the next paragraph.  Permission is also
granted to make copies of the files for personal purposes, like
backups, or to keep several versions of the compiler on different
machines or platforms.

You may not use the b2c compiler in a work, which is aimed at
developping, maintaining, transporting or using nuclear,
biological, chemical or similiar weapons, that can cause mass
death.  You may not use the b2c compiler in any mass persecution,
that leads to long term imprisonment or execution of people for
their political believe, sex, religion, color, place of birth or
faith.

You may distribute this program to up to 50 different people.
That means, that you may not put the code on a place, where you
cannot control distribution, like an ftp server.  If you want to
further distribute the files, feel free to ask me.  In most
cases, I will say "yes".  The distribution criteria will be
discarded, once version 1.0 of the compiler is out.

If you distribute a modified version, it must:
a) be marked as a modified version in a prominent place, like the
   filename of the distribution file AND in the main README file.
   Please add a README.<your-initials>, too, in the doc
   subdirectory, as well, as an e-mail address.
b) have all changes in the source code, that you made, be marked
   with your initials.
