Hi,

this is the current state of b2c, a freeware BETA compiler under
development.  Most of the code was written by Kai Petzke,
wpp@physik.tu-berlin.de.  The sources, and also general
information about BETA, can be found on the web home of b2c:

	http://troubadix.physik.tu-berlin.de/~petz0433/beta/ewelcome.html

This compiler understands about 95% of the BETA syntax.  The big
missing piece is support for Components.

To complete the installation of b2c, add a user named "b2c" to
your /etc/passwd, and give it the home directory, where you
unpacked the distribution.  Alternatively, you can install all
files in /usr/local/lib/b2c, the default directory.  The third
possibility is to unpack the distribution anywhere, and set the
B2C_HOME environment variable to the name of that directory.

The compiler is written in BETA, but it can't compile itself,
yet.  Binary versions for some platforms can be found on the URL
mentioned above.  Unpack those binary files from the same dir,
where you installed the source.  Then change to the test
subdirectory and play with the examples there.


If you have the Mjølner BETA system version 5.2 installed, you
can compile b2c yourself.  To do so, change to the src
subdirectory and type:

	beta -q b2c

The resulting binary should be copied to the bin directory using
the following command:

	cp b2c "../bin/`uname -m`-`uname -s`-b2c"


Finally, here is an overview of the most important directories in
this distribution.  If you are looking for more information, you
might find the "src/doc" directory helpfull:

basiclib	Standard BETA basic libraries.
bin		Binaries
containers	Standard BETA container libraries.
src		Source code
src/doc		Documentation (mostly technical)
terminal	BETA terminal interface library.
test		Test files for the compiler
