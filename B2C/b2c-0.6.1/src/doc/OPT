Possible optimizations of the BETA compiler:

1) Specially treat the dynamic generation of text objects from
   text constants.  Currently, these require about 5 C function
   calls.
2) GNU C allows the notation of global register variables.  Such
   a register could be used to pass the `this' pointer forth and
   back during function calls.  This is more efficient then the
   default function calling scheme, where values are passed on
   the stack.
3) GNU C assembly could be used to utilize the i386 bounds
   operation for checking the size of repetitions at run time.
4) Don't test the result of functions, that are known to not have
   a nonlocal LEAVE or RESTART.  Such functions must always
   return "success".
5) If a given attribute is inserted multiple times into some
   other object, may we unify these into one insertion?  This
   should save on both object space and code size.
6) A special object creator function is emitted for each virtual
   pattern.  If a given pattern is used in more than one virtual,
   this may be a waste.  It is left to the optimiser to inline
   the duplicate functions into one.
