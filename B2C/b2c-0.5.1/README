Hi,

this is the current state of b2c, a freeware BETA compiler under
development.  Most of the code was written by Kai Petzke,
wpp@physik.tu-berlin.de.  This compiler understands about 90% of
the BETA syntax.  The big missing pieces are "for" loops, and
anything, that has to do with Components.

To complete installation of b2c, add a user named "b2c" to your
/etc/passwd, and give it the home directory, where you unpacked
the distribution.  Alternatively, you can install all files in
/usr/local/lib/b2c, the default.

There are a few directories in the distribution.  They have the
following meanings:

basiclib	Standard BETA basic libraries.
bin		Binaries
containers	Standard BETA container libraries.
src		Source code
src/doc		Documentation of the Source code
test		Test files for the compiler

For more information, see the src/doc subdir.  Some comments are
also found in the source files.  For test driving the compiler
use the examples in the test directory, or write your own.

The compiler is written in BETA, but it can't compile itself yet.
For testing it, you need the Mjolner BETA system version 5.2
installed.  To compile b2c, change to the src subdir, and type:

	beta -q b2c

Please note once again, that this distribution is there to allow
people to join the work on the compiler, or to toy around with
BETA.  It is not something, that one would put on an "end user"
CD-ROM like a linux distribution.


Kai
