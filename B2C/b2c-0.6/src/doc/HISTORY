v0.6:
* Fixed bug number 1: the (for for) loop is implemented, now.
* Added the "BUILD" property, which shall make the use of Makefiles
  superfluous.
* Added the "CINCLUDE" property, which allows the specification of
  header files, which will be included in the generated .h output.
* A completely new experimental library: terminal, which is mostly
  a framework for the infamous unix curses libraries.  Yes, I need
  that for certain BETA applications.
* Yet another complete overhowl of file src/ad/backlevelbody.bet.
* systemjob interface to run arbitrary unix jobs.
* Several bug fixes:
  - correct list of #include's in the generated .h files now.
  - got rid of warning messages about possible future incompatibilities.
* The basic libraries are now named v1.5, in accordance to the
  libraries in the Mjølner system.
* Translate both ~beta and ~b2c at the beginning of a file name into
  the main directory of the b2c compiler.


v0.5.1:
* Several portability bug fixes:
  - Don't generate C code, that does arithmetic with void pointers.
  - Don't put casts on objects, that may appear on the left side of an
    assignment.  This fix may increase the number of type mismatch
    warnings, until a general solution is found.
  - Removed a superfluous semicolon to make a certain compiler happy,
    that would otherwise spill out lots of "empty declaration" warnings.
  - Changed the header of the LaTeX docs, in the hope, that the
    "epsfig" macro will now be reliably included.
  - Made `flex' the default lexer in the makefile `parse.make'.
  - Fixed two problems in `parse.y'.


v0.5:
* Moved the definitions of `ReduceFunction' (now called `reducefn'),
  `ReduceExit' and `ReduceExitSingle' out of the pattern `Evaluation'.
* Less messy implementation of the `reduce' method of `EnterExitComplex'.
* Support for passing string arguments to external C functions.
* Implemented the FILE pattern, see `basiclib/v1.4/file.bet'.
* New type of EXCEPTION handling.
* `keyboard' and `screen' are now of type FILE.
* Generally overworked `basiclib/v1.4/betaenv.bet'.
* Moved the main #define's to turn debugging on/off to beta.h.
* Several bug fixes:
  - The return value of external functions was ignored.
  - If file a.bet INCLUDE'd b.bet, that INCLUDE'd c.bet, and c.bet was updated,
    a.bet was not recompiled.
  - A few crashes, that were caused by illegal BETA input files.
  - The evaluation `&(# do ... #)[]->referenceVar[]' caused a crash during
    code generation.
  - The evaluation `(A->B)>0' caused a crash during the reduction phase.


v0.4: Mon, Feb 10 1997
* Implemented computed remotes.
* Fixed buggy algorithm for extending repetitions.
* Fixed bug, that allowed to bind a virtual to a virtual.


v0.3:
* Updated some of the documentation.
* Full support for virtual patterns.
* General if imperative.
* A btree container was added.
* Explicite handling of the type of a numerical expression.
* Migration to version 5.2 of the Mjølner BETA system.


v0.2:
* Changed semantics for virtual functions: the virtual creator function
  now either creates an object or fills in a pattern variable according
  to the virtual types.  The actual action depends on the parameters
  passed:

	struct object *V(struct object *enclosing, struct pvariable *pv);

  If the pv argument is zero, an object is created and a point to it
  is returned.  If pv is non-zero, information about the virtual
  object is stored into it, and the object creator function returns
  0.

* The Object Creator functions now can actually call other
  patterns.  If a LEAVE or RESTART imperative is triggered inside
  such a pattern, and cannot be handled there, the creation of
  the object will be aborted, and the Object Creator Function
  returns 0.

* Jiri Sitera <sitera@zcu.cz> added two changes:
  - You can create a list of the slots and their bindings by
    specifying the "-m" option to b2c.  The list is output in a
    program named <job>.sb, where <job> is the first filename
    specified to b2c.

    As this process relies on the ".fm" files to be present for
    each fragment of the current compile, and as these ".fm" files
    are only created, if the "-m" option had been specified, you
    may have to use the "-f" option along with "-m" to force a
    recompile of everything.

  - The storage of repetitions was changed to include another
    field, alsize, to allow the storage of the repetition to be
    allocated independently of its actual size.  That way, the
    system can choose independently of the BETA application, in
    which junks it extends a repetition's size.

* Jan Okrouhly <okrouhly@zcu.cz> has created a garbage collector.


v0.1:
This was the first version, that I gave to other people by sending
e-mail.
