Differences between b2c and Mjolner BETA system (incomplete list!):

Compiler:



BETAenv basic library:
- text.copy of b2c will set the copied text's stream position to the
  same as the original, while Mjolner sets it to the end.
- text.sub of b2c will set the copied text's stream position to the
  same character, if possible, as the original, while Mjolner sets it
  to the end of the new text.

- Exception handling.
