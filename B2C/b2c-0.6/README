Hi,

this is the current state of b2c, a freeware BETA compiler under
development.  Most of the code was written by Kai Petzke,
wpp@physik.tu-berlin.de.  This compiler understands about 95% of
the BETA syntax.  The big missing piece is support for
Components.

To complete the installation of b2c, add a user named "b2c" to
your /etc/passwd, and give it the home directory, where you
unpacked the distribution.  Alternatively, you can install all
files in /usr/local/lib/b2c, the default directory.  The third
possibility is to unpack the distribution anywhere, and set the
B2C_HOME environment variable to the name of that directory.

There are a few directories in the distribution.  They have the
following meanings:

basiclib	Standard BETA basic libraries.
bin		Binaries
containers	Standard BETA container libraries.
src		Source code
src/doc		Documentation of the Source code
terminal	BETA terminal interface library.
test		Test files for the compiler

For more information, see the src/doc subdir.  Some comments are
also found in the source files.  For test driving the compiler
use the examples in the test directory, or write your own.

The compiler is written in BETA, but it can't compile itself yet.
For testing it, you need the Mjølner BETA system version 5.2
installed.  To compile b2c, change to the src subdir, and type:

	beta -q b2c



Kai
