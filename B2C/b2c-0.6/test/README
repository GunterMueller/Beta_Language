These are some test input files for the current state of the BETA
compiler.  They are named from t1.bet to t12.bet.  The first few
just do a few syntax checks, while t8.bet and later do also some
real stuff.

You can compile and run all these files, if you start the script
called "regression".  When you do development on the compiler, it
is a very good idea to do this regularly, so that you detect it
as early as possible, if one of your changes/modifications
introduced a bug.

Before you use the BETA compiler b2c, you have to compile the
following file by hand:

	cc -c betamain.c
	cc -c gc.c
	cc -c mmalloc.c

Then generate the compiler itself:

	cd ..
	beta -q b2c

Then try to compile any of the test files in this directory:

	cd test
	../bin/b2c <filename>

as in:

	../b2c t8.bet
