<P>
Co-routine sequencing is sometimes considered as a "poor mans
concurrency."  This is hardly fair, since there is a trade off between
the need for concurrency control and the flexibility in
synchronization.  Co-routines represent the trade-off where
synchronization is simple, since "almost everything is a critical
region."  Using concurrency makes it harder to ensure correct sharing
of data, but on the other hand it its sometimes easier to ensure
progress in the program as a whole, because some thread will run as
long as any thread can do anything.  
</P>

<P>
In both cases, the modeling relation sometimes strongly suggests that
alternating (co-routine) sequencing or concurrent sequencing is the
natural approach to take.  After all, the world <EM>is</EM> massively
concurrent!  On the other hand, it gets more complicated, or at least
less customary, for the programmer to understand what is going on.
</P>

<H3>How does it look?</H3>
<P>
Both to get co-routine sequencing and concurrent sequencing,
the notion of <I>component</I> is needed.  A traditional BETA
syntax for expressing this is the <CODE>"|"</CODE> marker, e.g.:

  
<P>
  <CENTER>
    <TABLE BORDER=2 CELLPADDING=10 BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
      <TR><TD><CODE>&lt;Names&gt; ":" "@" "|" &lt;Merge&gt;</CODE></TD></TR>
    </TABLE>
  </CENTER>
</P>

This syntax has been preserved in <B>gbeta</B>, even though it has been
reinterpreted.  The full set of declarations was listed 
<A HREF="tutorial_index3.html" TARGET="display">earlier</A>, and they all include the <CODE>"|"</CODE>. 
</P>

<P>
In traditional BETA, the concept of component is at the same level as
the concept of object, i.e. objects and components are fundamentally
different things.  In <B>gbeta</B>, the notion of component has been
subordinated the notion of types, and the component properties
(notably the posession of an execution stack) is associated with a 
<A HREF="tutorial_index16.html" TARGET="display">basic pattern</A> called <CODE>component</CODE>.  The
<CODE>"|"</CODE> marker is reinterpreted as a type constraint which
ensures that <CODE>component</CODE> is present.
</P>

<H3>Example 8</H3>
<P>
As an example, we take a very famous algorithm which demonstrates that
co-routines is sometimes the most natural expression of alternating
processes, a slight variation of the version from
