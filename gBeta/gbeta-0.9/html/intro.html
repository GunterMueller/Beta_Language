<H1>What is <B>gbeta</B>?</H1>

<P>
<BIG><BIG><B>gbeta</B> is a generalization of the programming language
<A HREF="index_beta.html" TARGET="_top">BETA</A>.  You can <A HREF="index_download.html" TARGET="_top">download</A> a
compiler/interpreter for <B>gbeta</B>, and the source code of this
implementation is freely available under the <A HREF="index_copyright.html" TARGET="_top">GPL
copyright</A>.</BIG></BIG>

<H3>Here are some features of the language:</H3>
<P>
In <B>gbeta</B>, <EM>object metamorphosis</EM> coexists with strict,
static type-checking:  It is possible to take an existing object and
modify its structure until it is an instance of a given class, which
is possibly only known or even constructed at run-time.  Still, the
static analysis ensures that message-not-understood errors can never
occur at run-time.
</P>

<P>
It is possible to define relations between classes, e.g., to specify
that the class <TT>MyPoint</TT> must be a subclass of
<TT>YourPoint</TT> (without committing to exactly what classes they
are).  This makes it possible to define a kind of <EM>constraint graph
of classes</EM>.  It ensures that certain relations hold, such that
one inheritance operation may give rise to a complex but orderly
propagation of type changes in a framework of classes.
</P>

<P>
Like BETA, <B>gbeta</B> supports inheritance hierarchies not only for
classes but also for methods.  This can be used together with dynamic
inheritance to build <EM>dynamic control structures</EM>; dynamic
control structures enable your algorithms to be parameterized with
e.g. a while statement, an iteration through all elements of a given
list, or reading input from a file.  (NB: a control structure as a
parameter is richer than a procedure or function parameter, because the
control structure can provide a name space to its body).
</P>

<P>
BETA already has strong support for <EM>co-evolution of classes</EM>.
For example, the classes <CODE>vehicle</CODE> and
<CODE>operator</CODE> depend on each other, and they should "know"
each other's enhancement to <CODE>car</CODE> respectively
<CODE>chauffeur</CODE>.   The support for class co-evolution is even
more powerful and flexible in the generalized language <B>gbeta</B>,
enabling such things as the <CODE>observerDesignPattern</CODE> as a
class which can simply be used in stead of a micro-design-guide (a
"design pattern") which must  be re-implemented again and again.
</P>

<P>
Finally, you might want to get to know more about that weird language
called <EM>BETA</EM> that you have heard so much about but never
really tried out, hands on; the <B>gbeta</B> implementation provides in some
ways a more dynamic environment even if it is just used to try out
BETA programs. 
</P>

<P>
If you are interested in the design or implementation of modern,
object-oriented programming languages, you should take a closer look
at <B>gbeta</B>. <A HREF="index_beta.html" TARGET="_top">BETA</A> has been around since 1978 or so, but
still it is quite innovative and, IMHO it is very well-designed.
<B>gbeta</B> implements a superset of BETA,
<A HREF="index_compatibility.html" TARGET="_top">preserving</A> the static type checking and adding
a lot of <A HREF="index_advanced.html" TARGET="_top">new possibilities</A>.

<H3>Who doesn't want it, then?</H3>
<P>
There is currently no support for calling external code (e.g., C
libraries), and this prevents the execution of existing BETA programs
which could be compiled by e.g. the <A HREF="http://www.mjolner.dk/" TARGET="_top">Mjolner BETA System</A> because the basic
libraries of this system depend on some externals.  Another limitation
is in program size.  It 
would cost too much memory and take too long to run e.g. a
100,000 line program (using many libraries pushes the effective
line-count up); 3000 lines is more realistic, especially if
<A HREF="index_lazy.html" TARGET="_top">lazy analysis</A> is used to achieve a quick startup time.
The current <B>gbeta</B> implementation is more for the (possibly academic)
geek who is interested in programming language design, and less for
the no-nonsense practical programmer who wants to write large
mission-critical applications.  In other words, it's slow but it uses
a lot of memory.  Finally, the library support is hardly existing by
now.  There is a fair chance that some libraries from the Mjolner BETA System
will be adapted to work with <B>gbeta</B> and made available somehow for
free, but this hasn't happened yet.

<H3>Why was it created?</H3>
<P>
It has been developed as part of my PhD project, as a workbench for
language design experiments and as a proof-of-concept implementation.
The emphasis has been on a clear, high-level expression of the
language semantics.  This means that language design experiments
can be made at a high level by modifying the <B>gbeta</B> implementation
itself, using the existing, rather well-encapsulated abstractions.
Moreover the implementation is very general, supporting a number of
"gray corners" of BETA which have not been implemented in the
Mjolner BETA System.
</P>

<P>
Nevertheless, the main point in implementing the entire language from 
scratch was to rethink the basic concepts of the language, and to
rebuild a language which has traditional BETA as a special case, but
at the same time enhances the expressive power considerably.
</P>

<H3><A HREF="mailto:eernst@cs.auc.dk">Feed-back</A></H3> 
<P>
is always welcome,
about the language and/or its implementation, about the language
design effort that it incarnates, and about this web site.

<H3>Aahhh, yes...</H3>

...the funny symbol on the many colored background is a <B>gbeta</B> logo, a
stylized version of the letters "gb".  You are welcome to use this
logo on your own web pages if you want to refer to <B>gbeta</B>.  And here

GNU Emacs (click on it to see more):
