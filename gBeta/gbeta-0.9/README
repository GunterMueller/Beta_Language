This is an implementation of the programming language gbeta, which is
a generalization of the language BETA.  For more information about
gbeta and this implementation, please take a look at the web site:

  http://www.cs.auc.dk/~eernst/gbeta/

A snapshot of this site is also distributed in this package, in the 
directory html.  Details about installation and getting started are
also given in the pages of this web site.

The language gbeta is (essentially) backwards compatible with the 
language BETA, which is a direct successor to the first OO language,
Simula.  To learn more about the language BETA, check out this site:

  http://www.cs.auc.dk/~beta/

Compared to BETA, gbeta is built on a more general semantic foundation 
(based on full-fledged mixins), and this enhances the expressive 
power and flexibility of the language and its type system.  For 
instance, the combination of (generalized) virtual attributes and 
general block structure gives rise to a phenomenon which is called 
"propagating combinations".  This might be described as a tightly 
language integrated implementation mechanism for aspect oriented 
programming.  More details can be found in the paper "Propagating 
Class and Method Combination", Proceedings ECOOP'99.  Some important 
properties of the type system are presented in the paper "Family 
Polymorphism", Proceedings ECOOP'01.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a man page in the distribution (the file doc/gbeta.1) which 
documents the command line arguments/options, as well as the command
language which is used during interactive sessions.

Feed back about gbeta is highly appreciated, both about the language
design effort that it incarnates and its implementation.  You are
welcome to perform experiments based on gbeta---in that case, do not 
hesitate to contact me for help or discussions!  The USENET news 
group comp.lang.beta would also be an appropriate place for 
such discussions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This implementation of gbeta is written in the Mjolner BETA System (an
implementation of BETA with a compiler, a structure editor, a
debugger, and much more).  This means that you would need the Mjolner
BETA System in order to recompile gbeta.

The Mjolner BETA System used to be for sale only, but it can now be
downloaded for free, so you can compile gbeta and experiment with
variations as you like.  The language may still be developed, but my
primary plans are concerned with improvements of the implementation,
in order to provide true separate compilation, better performance,
generating machine code instead of byte code, etc.etc.

Version 0.9 of gbeta fits in with the release 5.5 of Mjolner BETA.
