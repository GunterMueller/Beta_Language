(# (* This demonstrates that internal threads continue
    * to run during the execution of an external process
    * (here: slowscript) when ossystem is evaluated.  If
    * ossystem is not evaluated ('..->ossystem' in stead of
    * '..->ossystem->..'), the interpretation stops until
    * the external process finishes.  This is to avoid mixing
    * output from the external process with output from 
    * internal threads.
    * 
    * You may have to adjust the value '2000' in order to 
    * get the right relation between the time taken by the 
    * internal and the external processing *)
